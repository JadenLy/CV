# CV

This is a repository for Computer Vision tasks, including image classification and object detection. 

The codes are generally implemented PyTorch. I will post the whole script once I completed reading the paper and writingthe code for the implementation. 

Due to the fact that I only work on my MacBook Pro, which has no GPU support, I will only include the GPU as an option in the front. Please change the setting if you would like to use my script. 

## Process:
- [x] LeNet
- [x] AlexNet
- [x] ResNet
- [ ] Inception
- [ ] Fast RCNN
- [ ] Faster RCNN

## Required Package
[torch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)

[torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/master/torchvision)

Please refer to [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and  for assistance on installation, and [PyTorch Documentation](http://pytorch.org/docs/0.3.0/) for further documentation on PyTorch.
