# CV

This is a repository for Computer Vision tasks, including image classification and object detection. 

The codes are generally implemented PyTorch. I will post the whole script once I completed reading the paper and writingthe code for the implementation. 

Due to the fact that I only work on my MacBook Pro, which has no GPU support, I will only include the GPU as an option in the front. Please change the setting if you would like to use my script.
